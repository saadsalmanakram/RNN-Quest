Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of artificial neural networks designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data, such as time series, speech, text, or other sequential data. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs have connections that loop back, allowing information to persist. This feature makes RNNs suitable for tasks where context or previous elements in the sequence influence later elements.
